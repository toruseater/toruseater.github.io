Hello! I'm a pre-undergrad computer science student from the UK. I made this blog because I think writing about the things I learn will help me understand them more deeply.

I'm mainly interested in computer science and maths, and how I can learn them better. Currently I'm teaching myself foundational subjects like calculus, linear algebra and programming (primarily C++), but eventually I want to pursue a career in computer graphics.
